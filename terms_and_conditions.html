      Considering this, make sure to give your date a good enough reason, lie or not. 
      Please note that Ohio Hotel only provides one free date per person. 
      Therefore, if your date cancels the date, you must do so as well to avoid losing your free date. 
      Keep in mind that you can bring a date of your own if your Cupid 2.0 date cancels on you.

      Billing and Refund Policy
      Cupid 2.0 and the Ohio Hotel will be paying for your full date.

      the private gourmet diner (8 Michelin stars), and the private theatre which provides a wide range of 
      films from Romance to Horror. You are also allowed 24-hour access to the private pool, jacuzzi, 
      couple’s massage parlor, and spa. Your private Hotel room comes with cameras fixed at many angles 
      which can be turned on and off according to your will. If you wish to film your experience, feel free to do so. 
      To get your free clips, please consult the receptionist at the Hotel who will provide you with a pen drive with your video. 
      Please note that Cupid 2.0 and the Ohio Hotel only offer to pay up to $10.
      If the cost exceeds the amount we offer to pay, you’ll have to pay for it yourself.

      You will not get your amount back regardless our how bad the date was and you will be getting only one date.
